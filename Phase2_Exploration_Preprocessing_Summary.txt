MEDBOT - PHASE 2: EXPLORATION & PREPROCESSING SUMMARY
=====================================================

Repository Link: https://github.com/[your-username]/MedBot
(Replace with actual repository URL)

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
MedBot is an AI-powered study buddy designed to help students navigate through massive medical textbooks without having to manually parse through 15,000+ pages of content.

CURRENT REPOSITORY STATE:
========================

FILES STRUCTURE:
- README.md: Basic project description and installation guide (incomplete)
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies (langchain_community, pypdf, re)
- preprocess_and_convert_to_chroma.py: Main preprocessing script
- data/: Contains Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st Edition PDF

PREPROCESSING IMPLEMENTATION:
============================

The main preprocessing script (preprocess_and_convert_to_chroma.py) performs:

1. PDF LOADING:
   - Uses PyPDFLoader from langchain_community
   - Loads Harrison's medical textbook (21st Edition)
   - Extracts 13,796 useful pages (removes index and citation pages)

2. DOCUMENT CLEANING:
   - Removes empty lines
   - Filters out page numbers
   - Removes "Page X of Y" headers
   - Eliminates ALL CAPS headers
   - Removes divider lines (dashes, underscores)

3. CONTENT NORMALIZATION:
   - Fixes hyphenated words split across lines
   - Consolidates multiple newlines into single spaces
   - Removes excessive whitespace
   - Strips leading/trailing whitespace

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=================

Dependencies:
- langchain_community: For PDF document loading
- pypdf: PDF processing backend
- re: Regular expressions for text cleaning

Data Processing:
- Source: 15,000+ page medical textbook
- Processed: 13,796 pages after filtering
- Cleaning: Multi-stage text normalization pipeline

GIT HISTORY:
===========
- Initial commit: Data ingestion, preprocessing and cleaning
- Subsequent commits: Handling large file uploads to repository

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ PDF loading and parsing implemented
✅ Text cleaning and preprocessing pipeline complete
✅ Document structure preservation
⏳ Chroma vector database conversion (mentioned in filename but not implemented)
⏳ AI chatbot interface (not yet implemented)
⏳ Complete installation instructions

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Complete Chroma vector database conversion
2. Implement AI query interface
3. Add proper error handling
4. Complete README with installation instructions
5. Add configuration options for different textbooks

This repository represents Phase 2 of the MedBot project, focusing on data exploration and preprocessing of medical textbook content for AI-powered study assistance.
