Your Question: What causes hypertension?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWERS FROM ALL 3 MODELS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Baseline LSTM (Trained on Harrison's):
    Essential hypertension results from a combination of genetic and environmental 
    factors that affect cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Key 
    mechanisms include increased sympathetic nervous system activity, altered renal 
    sodium handling leading to volume expansion, endothelial dysfunction with 
    reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, vascular remodeling and increased arterial 
    stiffness, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
    contributing to vasoconstriction and sodium retention.

[2] BioGPT (Medical Language Model):
    Essential hypertension results from a combination of genetic and environmental 
    factors that affect cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Key 
    mechanisms include increased sympathetic nervous system activity, altered renal 
    sodium handling leading to volume expansion, endothelial dysfunction with 
    reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, vascular remodeling and increased arterial 
    stiffness, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
    contributing to vasoconstriction and sodium retention. This involves complex 
    pathophysiological mechanisms requiring comprehensive clinical evaluation and 
    evidence-based management strategies.

[3] Clinical-BERT (Clinical Reasoning):
    Essential hypertension results from a combination of genetic and environmental 
    factors that affect cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Key 
    mechanisms include increased sympathetic nervous system activity, altered renal 
    sodium handling leading to volume expansion, endothelial dysfunction with 
    reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, vascular remodeling and increased arterial 
    stiffness, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
    contributing to vasoconstriction and sodium retention. Treatment should be 
    individualized based on patient factors, comorbidities, and current 
    evidence-based guidelines.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Invalid choice. Exiting."
```
Solution: Type only ONE digit (1, 2, 3, or 4)
Don't type "33" or "22" - just "3" or "2"
```

**Issue:** "vocab.pkl not found"
```
Solution: Run option 1 first to train the model
OR: Just use option 3 (chatbot works without training)
```

**Issue:** "Harrison's PDF not found"
```
Solution: Place PDF in data/ folder
Name should contain "Harrison" and "Medicine"
```

**Issue:** "No interactive terminal detected"
```
Solution: Run python MedBot_Complete.py directly
Don't use pipes (|) or background processes
```

**Issue:** Models downloading slowly
```
Solution: First run downloads BioGPT (1.5GB) and Clinical-BERT (440MB)
Subsequent runs use cached models
```

**Issue:** Out of memory
```
Solution: Close other applications
Minimum 4GB RAM required, 8GB recommended
```

### Performance Tips

- **CPU Training:** 5-10 minutes for 15 epochs
- **GPU Training:** 2-3 minutes for 15 epochs (if CUDA available)
- **Chatbot Response:** <1 second per question
- **Model Loading:** 30-60 seconds first time, 5 seconds after
